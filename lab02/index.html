            <p>Hello! This is a simple page I made while learning HTML. It was very difficult 
                at the start, due to not knowing what each term meant or how to use them properly, but with each Step
                It has become much more and more manageable. I feel as if, although my knowledge is still spotty
                The ability to create a basic web page will come in handy. The start of the process had me very confused, 
                And although I am not a pro, I do believe the process will get easier with time.
            </p>
